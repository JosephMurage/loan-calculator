# Loan Calculator

I decided to try something different, and here it is, a Loan Calculator!

I hope to tweak it more as time goes by, and integrate it into actual business websites that I have in mind.

It is intended for those planning to buy a car, a house, or need a loan for any other purpose, to assist you in making informed financial decisions.

## What Does the Loan Calculator Do?

The Loan Calculator app, powered by a Flask backend and HTML frontend, allows you to input your loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan term in years. With just a click of a button, you'll instantly get detailed information about your loan, including:

- **Monthly Payment**: The amount you'll need to pay each month.
- **Total Interest Payable**: The total amount of interest you'll pay over the loan term.
- **Total Payment**: The total amount you'll pay back, including both the principal and interest.

## How to Use the App

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JosephMurage/loan-calculator.git
   cd loan-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
      ```sh
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the App**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You'll see the loan calculator interface where you can enter your loan details and get instant calculations.

## Future Plans

I'm just getting started! ðŸš€ Here are some exciting plans I have for this web app:

- **Beautiful and Responsive Design**: I'll enhance the user interface using modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to make it look stunning on any device.
- **Interactive Features**: Adding JavaScript to provide real-time updates as you input your loan details, making the user experience seamless and engaging.
- **Additional Calculations**: Introducing more financial calculations, such as amortization schedules, to give you deeper insights into your loan.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing user accounts so you can save your calculations and access them anytime, anywhere.

Stay tuned for these updates and more!
